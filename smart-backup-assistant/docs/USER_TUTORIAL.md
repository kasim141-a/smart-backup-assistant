3. **Confirm the Action**
   - Read the message: "Are you sure you want to create a backup now?"
   - Click **Confirm** to proceed
   - Click **Cancel** if you changed your mind

4. **Wait for Completion**
   - A progress bar will appear
   - You'll see "Backing up your Home Assistant configuration..."
   - This typically takes 2-5 minutes depending on your system size

5. **Success!**
   - You'll see a notification: "Backup created successfully!"

## Validating a Backup

### What is Backup Validation?

**Validation** checks if a backup is safe to restore. It's like a health check for your backup!

The add-on checks:
- ‚úÖ Version compatibility (is the backup from a similar HA version?)
- ‚úÖ Breaking changes (will anything stop working?)
- ‚úÖ Missing add-ons (are all add-ons still available?)
- ‚úÖ Risk assessment (how safe is it to restore?)

### When Should I Validate?

**Always validate before restoring!** Especially if:
- The backup is old (more than a few months)
- You've updated Home Assistant since creating the backup
- You're restoring to a different device
- You want to check what's in the backup

### How to Validate

1. **Select a Backup**
   - In the System Status card, you'll see "Last Backup"
   - Note the backup name and date

2. **Click "Validate"**
   - In the Quick Actions card
   - The button has a checkmark icon (‚úì)

3. **Wait for Validation**
   - This takes 10-30 seconds
   - The add-on is analyzing the backup

4. **Review the Results**
   - A detailed report will appear with:
     - **Status**: Compatible, Compatible with Warnings, or Incompatible
     - **Risk Level**: Low, Medium, or High
     - **Version Info**: Backup version vs. current version
     - **Issues**: Problems that might occur
     - **Warnings**: Things to be aware of

### Understanding Validation Results

#### ‚úÖ Compatible (Low Risk)
```
Status: Compatible
Risk Level: Low
Backup Version: 2024.10.1
Current Version: 2024.10.2

‚úì Backup is safe to restore!
```

**What this means:** Go ahead! The backup is from a similar version and should restore without issues.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Compatible with Warnings (Medium Risk)
```
Status: Compatible with Warnings
Risk Level: Medium
Backup Version: 2024.9.1
Current Version: 2024.10.1

Warnings:
- Minor version difference detected
- 2 add-ons from backup are not currently installed

‚ö† Backup can be restored but proceed with caution.
```

**What this means:** The backup should work, but there might be minor issues. Read the warnings carefully.

#### ‚ùå Incompatible (High Risk)
```
Status: Incompatible
Risk Level: High
Backup Version: 2023.12.1
Current Version: 2024.10.1

Issues:
- Major version mismatch
- Breaking changes detected in 3 integrations

‚úó Backup restoration is not recommended.
```
